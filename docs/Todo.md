# Bugs

- high scores are not always in numerical order.
  - pass the number through to HighScores.vue as a number, and convert to Locale String in the component
- hide Next Piece when in gameIdle mode
- hide Pause/Resume when in gameIdle mode

# Enhancements

- add name to high scores
- add global storing of High Scores, to enable high scores sharing between devices, and for users to compete on different devices
- add changing of themes (eg colours)
- add a Settings and About and Help and Scoring screens
